By enrolling in Edurekaâ€™s React JS course, you can develop applications that are consistent in behavior, cross-platform, and easy to test and deploy. React JS also allows you to construct complex UIs using small, self-contained pieces of code known as \"components.\" React is capable of server-side rendering with Node and can power native apps using React Native."
